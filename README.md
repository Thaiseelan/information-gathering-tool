# IP Address Lookup Script

This script retrieves the IP address of a given URL and provides geolocation details, such as the location (latitude and longitude), region, and country associated with the IP address. It uses the [ipinfo.io API](https://ipinfo.io/) for geolocation data.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `requests` library (install with `pip install requests` if not already installed)

### Command Line

To run the script, use the following command:

python script_name.py <url>
Replace script_name.py with the name of the Python script and <url> with the URL you want to look up.

Example
python ip_lookup.py example.com
Output
If the lookup is successful, the script outputs:

The IP address of the specified URL
The latitude and longitude coordinates
The region and country of the IP address
Example output:

The IP address of example.com is: 93.184.216.34
Location (lat, long): 37.751,-97.822
Region: California
Country: US

Error Handling
The script handles common errors, such as:

Invalid or unreachable URL
Issues with network requests
Errors are displayed with an appropriate message.

API Key
The script uses the ipinfo.io API. You will need an API key to access location data.

Replace the placeholder value in the script:

python
Copy code
IPINFO_API_KEY = "your_api_key_here"
You can get a free API key by signing up at ipinfo.io.
